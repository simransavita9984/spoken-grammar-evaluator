# ðŸŽ§ Grammar Scoring Engine â€“ Predict Spoken Grammar Quality

This project aims to develop a Grammar Scoring Engine that evaluates **spoken audio samples** and predicts **grammar scores** on a **MOS (Mean Opinion Score)** scale from **0 to 5**. The model is trained using **MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)** extracted from audio features and uses **machine learning regression models** to predict a continuous grammar score.

## ðŸš€ Objective

Given a `.wav` audio file (spoken English), predict the **grammar score** of the speaker on a scale of 0 (poor grammar) to 5 (excellent grammar). This can be useful in **spoken English assessment tools**, **language learning platforms**, and **voice-based AI evaluation systems**.
